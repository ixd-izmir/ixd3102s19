Concept Pitch Presentation Boards
-
The focus of your presentation is the general idea of the game itself and for that reason you should carefully explain your concepts concept through the following boards:  

- introduction: a board including title and a one sentence description* (optional teasing visuals)  
- detailed description: scenario if story-centred, descriptive if focused on the game mechanics  
- moodboard: references for aesthetic  
- "techboard": references for mechanics and game style
- storyboard: storyboard with references to mechanics  
- final look: one image representing a preview of the game look (even in a more sketch formed considering the short time available)  

Every group will have 5 minutes.

one sentence description*
-
Regarding the one sentence we want you to focus the attention to the right aspects of the game. You should immediately state what is the game that you have in your mind to create a common ground for understanding. Here some notes on how to do that:

**One Sentence to Sum Up the Game**

This sentence needs to be sharp as a knife. Its purpose is to get people who will like the game to read on, and get rid of people who won’t. You have to get the main “game fun” across in just one sentence.

Try to establish the key goal of the game, the theme of the game, and the main mechanic. You don’t need many words to do this. Here’s the one sentence description for Dynomite by PopCap:

“It’s prehistoric egg blasting fun!”

Theme — dinosaurs. Key goal — destroy eggs somehow. Mechanic — unclear, but involves blasting so there’s probably explosions. Oh, and it’s fun by the way. A brilliant one sentence summary that tells the player a lot in only five words.

The one sentence summary absolutely needs to end with an exclamation point. And it needs to earn that exclamation point too.

How can you sum up your game in just a few words?

**The mistakes often made by indie game developers:**
1. Not explaining the actual game.
2. Explaining the artistic intent.
3. Explaining the plot.
4. Saying your game is awesome. Or as Francis puts it, "No one has ever heard a developer say, 'Our game is innovative,' and thought, wow, that game is innovative."

**Tips to help indie game developers introduce their work to the rest of the world.**
1. Say what type of game it is.
2. Tell us the coolest unique thing about it before you finish the first sentence.
3. Provide context, which is to say, explain who are the characters and what is the world.
4. Describe a moment the player can experience.
