## Description
This course introduces the concept and practice of physical computing.

The aim is to design and prototype physical intefaces for interaction using the widespread electronic prototyping platforms (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi).

The main outcome will consist in a design proposal for an installation in a museum of Izmir.

The contribution of external professionals and academicians will help to clarify the complexity of the work and the involved stakeholder.

## Outcomes
1. Develop techniques and theories to make interactive physical artifacts
2. Apply methodologies and theories to the design practice
3. Learn to structure project planning for a physical interactive device
4. Prepare professional solutions to wicked (design) problems
5. Improve social skills while collaborating in small groups
6. Develop unique design approaches individually
